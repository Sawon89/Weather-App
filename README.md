🌤️ Just launched my Weather App project!

I'm excited to share a responsive weather application I built using HTML, CSS (Bootstrap), and JavaScript. This project integrates live data from the OpenWeatherMap API and demonstrates practical frontend skills.

✅ Key Features:

Real-time current weather details (temperature, humidity, wind speed)

5-day forecast with responsive design

City name autocomplete with worldwide search suggestions (via OpenWeatherMap Geocoding API)

Animated backgrounds that change based on weather conditions

Mobile-friendly UI with Bootstrap 5 for professional styling

🛠️ Goals of the project:

Practice real-world API integration

Improve asynchronous JavaScript skills

Enhance user experience with autocomplete and design responsiveness

💡 I learned a lot about building user-friendly web applications and handling API responses efficiently.

👉 I’d love any feedback or suggestions!
